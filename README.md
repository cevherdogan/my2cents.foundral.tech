# Foundral — Organizational & Operational Index (v1.0)

This package is intentionally separate from any single book or publication.

Purpose:
- Act as a living index of experiments, frameworks, and initiatives
- Keep organizational, operational, and regenerative work distinct from book tracks
- Provide a calm, extensible structure for Foundral-related efforts

This is infrastructure, not content.

## New in v1.1
- Added `ops/` directory for operational artifacts (separate from book/publishing tracks).
- Added Magic HTML prerequisite guide: `ops/foundral_prerequisites_magic.html`.

## What's included (expanded in v1.2)
- Operational prerequisites (Magic HTML + quickstart)
- Publishing & distribution copy (Substack/Medium/Gumroad/LinkedIn)
- Series governance (Substack series map + Comparative Atlas signature rules)
- Minimal Foundral landing page (HTML)

## v1.2.1 additions
- Canonical links placeholder table
- End-to-end publishing checklist

## v1.2.2
- Added Magic HTML mirrors for OPS Markdown docs
- Added `ops_magic_index.html` for navigation

## v1.2.3 additions (January 7, 2026)
- docs/new_book_checklist.md + .html (repeatable checklist)
- docs/beam_book_blueprint.md + .html (book blueprint template, BEAM-focused)
