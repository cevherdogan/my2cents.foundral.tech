# Foundral OPS — New Book Checklist (v1.0)

**Date:** January 7, 2026  
**Purpose:** A repeatable, *no-drama* checklist to go from *idea → publish → distribute → monetize*, while keeping **Book Track** separate from **OPS Track**.

> **Reminder:** Educational content only; nothing here is investment advice. For financial topics, add an explicit disclaimer in your book and posts.

---

## 0) Decide the track: Book vs OPS
- [ ] **Book Track repo/folder** created (content, manuscript, visuals, citations, KDP assets)
- [ ] **OPS Track repo/folder** updated (links, launch checklist, index pages, templates)

**Rule:** *Never* mix raw manuscript drafts into OPS.
