# Foundral Book Blueprint — *BEAM Therapeutics at the Frontier* (v0.1)

**Date:** January 7, 2026  
**Scope:** BEAM as the anchor, compared with **SANA, ABCL, CRSP, NTLA, EDIT, CRBU, DNA, SDGR**.  
**Tone:** Narrative + analytical lens. **Not investment advice.**

---

## 1) Core promise (reader-facing)
**“Understand the gene-editing battlefield in human terms—why the science matters, where the risks hide, and how to read signals without pretending to predict.”**

---

## 2) Book structure (suggested)
1. **The Frontier Problem** (what gene editing *is*, and why it’s hard)
2. **BEAM’s Base-Editing Thesis** (how it differs from “classic” CRISPR narratives)
3. **The Peers** (CRSP/NTLA/EDIT/CRBU/SANA/ABCL/DNA/SDGR—what each *really* is)
4. **Cash as Oxygen** (free cash flow reality, runway, dilution mechanics)
5. **Signals, Not Predictions** (market psychology + setup reading)
6. **Time in Market vs Time the Market** (how to think in regimes)
7. **Catalysts & Failure Modes** (trial data, regulatory, manufacturing, partnerships)
8. **A Practical Reader Toolkit** (checklists, templates, definitions)
9. **Ethics & Disclaimers** (how to write responsibly)
10. **Appendix** (glossary, sources, matrices)

## 3) “Best practice” indicators (human readable)

### Fundamentals (cash & durability)
- **Operating cash flow / free cash flow (FCF):** for many biotech names, FCF is often negative—so the real question becomes **cash runway** and **capital strategy**.
- **Cash runway heuristic:**  
  `Cash & equivalents ÷ (TTM operating cash burn)` → *months of oxygen*.
- **Debt profile:** when debt is meaningful, check covenants + maturities.
- **Partner validation:** deals can extend runway and de-risk programs.

### Narrative / sector signals
- **Modality clarity:** base editing vs CRISPR nuclease vs cell therapy vs platform services.
- **Clinical proof:** durability, safety, manufacturing scalability.
- **Regulatory momentum:** designations, trial progress, endpoints clarity.

### Technical (signals only)
- **Trend regime:** weekly/monthly trend > daily noise.
- **Fibonacci retracement:** a support/resistance lens (not a prophecy).
- **Elliott wave:** best used as a *structure hypothesis* with invalidation levels.

## 4) “Where they stand now” (signal snapshot)
Use this table as a *structure map* (levels from 52-week range) — **not** entry advice.

> Levels below are “52-week key points” (high/low + common Fibonacci retracements).

| Ticker | 52W High | 52W Low | Fib 61.8% | Fib 50% | Fib 38.2% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| BEAM | 35.25 | 13.52 | 26.95 | 24.39 | 21.82 |
| CRSP | 78.48 | 30.04 | 59.98 | 54.26 | 48.54 |
| NTLA | 28.25 | 5.90 | 19.71 | 17.08 | 14.44 |
| EDIT | 4.54 | 0.91 | 3.15 | 2.72 | 2.30 |
| CRBU | 3.54 | 0.66 | 2.4398 | 2.10 | 1.7602 |
| SANA | 7.30 | 1.26 | 4.99 | 4.28 | 3.57 |
| ABCL | 6.51 | 1.89 | 4.75 | 4.20 | 3.66 |
| DNA | 17.58 | 5.00 | 12.77 | 11.29 | 9.81 |
| SDGR | 28.47 | 15.99 | 23.70 | 22.23 | 20.76 |

## 5) Fib + Elliott “entry points” without advice (the safe way)
Instead of saying “buy here,” you write:

- **If price is above Fib 61.8%**: momentum regime; demand confirmation (volume, higher lows).  
- **If price is between 50% and 61.8%**: watch for consolidation and reclaim signals.  
- **If price is below 38.2%**: often risk-on fades; focus on “survival” (cash + catalysts) and avoid storytelling.

**Elliott wave guidance (responsible):**
- Treat wave counts as **hypotheses**.
- Always define **invalidation** (“if price breaks X, the count is wrong”).
- Prefer **weekly** chart wave structure; use daily only for refinement.

## 6) Chapter-level prompt pack (copy/paste)

### Thesis & narrative
1) “Write a 900-word chapter draft explaining BEAM’s base-editing approach to a non-technical reader, using one analogy and one real-world example. End with 5 bullet takeaways.”  
2) “Compare BEAM vs CRSP vs NTLA in a neutral tone. Use: modality, maturity, risks, catalysts, and cash runway questions.”

### Fundamentals
3) “Create a cash-runway worksheet template (inputs + formulas) and explain each field in plain English.”  
4) “List the top 10 red flags in biotech financials and how to confirm them in a 10-Q.”

### Technical signals
5) “Given these Fib levels and the current price, describe 3 possible *market structure* scenarios and what would invalidate each.”  
6) “Explain Elliott wave in 250 words, then give a checklist for counting waves without overfitting.”

### Sector framing
7) “Summarize the gene-editing sector in 800 words: key modalities, regulatory issues, manufacturing constraints, and investor psychology.”
