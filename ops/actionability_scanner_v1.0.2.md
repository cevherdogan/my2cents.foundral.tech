# Foundral Actionability Upgrade — Advice-Language Scanner v1.0.2

**Purpose:** Preserve usefulness and promotive clarity **without** crossing into directive advice.

## Core Rule
> Enable judgment, do not own the decision.

---

## What to Avoid (Directive Ownership)
- “You should…”, “Now is the time…”, “Best entry/exit”
- Outcome certainty (“will”, “guarantees”)
- Winner-picking without a framework

---

## What to Prefer (Action-Enabling)
### Conditional Scenarios
“If X persists while Y weakens, structure shifts toward…”

### Threshold & Invalidation
“Below this level, the framework invalidates.”

### Decision Checklists
“Before acting, three conditions typically matter…”

### Comparative Pressure Points
“Improves precision at the cost of scalability.”

---

## Promotive but Responsible Language
- Promote **frameworks**, not outcomes
- Promote **capability**, not certainty
- Promote **clarity**, not urgency

Example:
“This book equips readers with lenses to evaluate timing, risk, and durability without predictions.”

## Final Gate (10 seconds)
Ask:
1. Does this sharpen perception?
2. Does it surface trade-offs?
3. Does it avoid telling the reader what to do?

If yes → publish.
