## Version A
I write about systems at inflection points — technology, infrastructure, and strategy — without forcing certainty.
No predictions. No rankings. Just structured thinking about trade-offs and execution under constraint.

## Version B
Some systems stop behaving the way we expect. My work explores trade-offs, dependencies, and signals that matter more than headlines.
No hype cycles. Calm, long-term thinking.
