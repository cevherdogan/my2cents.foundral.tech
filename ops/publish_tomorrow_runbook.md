**Foundral OPS — v1.0.1**
**Date:** 2026-01-07

## Morning (2–3 hours)

### 1️⃣ Amazon KDP (Primary Record)
- Upload manuscript (ebook or paperback)
- Upload cover
- Paste description (neutral, non-promotional)
- Select categories conservatively
- Keywords: descriptive, not hype
- Save as **Draft** or **Publish**

✅ Output: Amazon product URL (or ASIN placeholder)

---

### 2️⃣ Heyzine (Visual Experience)
- Upload same PDF
- Choose clean flipbook theme
- Disable distractions
- Set public or unlisted
- Copy share link

✅ Output: Heyzine URL

---

### 3️⃣ Gumroad (Monetization)
- Product title = Book title
- Description = same as KDP (slightly shorter)
- Attach PDF
- Price: simple (or pay-what-you-want)
- Enable receipt emails

✅ Output: Gumroad product URL

---

## Afternoon (1–2 hours)

### 4️⃣ Substack (Canonical Narrative)
- Post title: reflective, not salesy
- Sections:
  - Why this book
  - What it is / isn’t
  - Who it’s for
  - Links (Heyzine + Gumroad + Amazon)
- Publish

✅ Output: Substack post URL

---

### 5️⃣ LinkedIn (Distribution)
- Short post (6–8 lines)
- Calm tone, no CTA pressure
- Pin the post
- Link to Substack (single source of truth)

✅ Output: LinkedIn post URL

---

## End of Day (15 minutes)

### OPS Hygiene
- [ ] Update links_placeholders table
- [ ] Increment OPS ZIP version
- [ ] Add entry to CHANGELOG
- [ ] Archive Book ZIP separately

---

## Golden Rules
- One PDF everywhere
- One canonical narrative (Substack)
- No edits after publish day
- Version later, not today

---

## If Something Breaks
- Amazon delay → proceed with Heyzine + Gumroad
- Gumroad delay → free Heyzine + Substack
- LinkedIn delay → still publish Substack

Publishing compounds. Perfection delays.
