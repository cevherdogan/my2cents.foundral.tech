# Medium Profile / About (Mirror)

I write about **systems at inflection points** — technology, infrastructure, capital intensity, and policy.

Rather than predictions or hot takes, I focus on:
- Strategic trade-offs
- Execution under constraint
- Comparative frameworks that reveal different ways to succeed in the same system
- Signals that matter more than headlines

No investment advice. No rankings. Calm, structured thinking.

I publish when there’s something worth exploring — not on a fixed schedule.
