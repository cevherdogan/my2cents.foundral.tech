# Substack Post #2 — Signals, Not Predictions

Most analysis fails at the exact moment it’s needed most — because prediction becomes irresistible when uncertainty rises.

At inflection points, the demand for certainty spikes. And that’s precisely when certainty becomes least reliable.

## Why predictions break down
Inflection points violate stable relationships, repeatable cycles, and known feedback loops.
Outcomes are shaped by alignment: execution vs ambition, capital vs patience, policy vs operational reality.

## What a signal is
A signal is an observable change that:
- persists over time
- affects multiple layers of a system
- constrains future options

Signals narrow the range of futures without pretending to choose one.

## Practice
When you see a confident prediction, ask:
“What signal would need to persist for this to be true?”
If no clear signal exists, the prediction is noise.

Some systems reward speed. The most important ones reward **attention**.
