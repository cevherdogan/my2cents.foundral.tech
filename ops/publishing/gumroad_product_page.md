## Product Title
**Intel at the Crossroads**  
*A Comparative Atlas of Strategy, Manufacturing, and Power*

## Description
This is not a book about a stock.

*Intel at the Crossroads* is a calm, structured examination of how complex systems behave at inflection points — using Intel and the semiconductor industry as a case study.

Rather than predictions or recommendations, the book offers comparative frameworks to understand:
- Why some companies absorb complexity while others monetize it
- How manufacturing becomes strategy
- What execution under constraint looks like
- Why industrial policy reshapes risk without guaranteeing success

The work introduces the **Foundral Comparative Atlas** — a reusable lens for mapping strategic trade-offs across industries.
