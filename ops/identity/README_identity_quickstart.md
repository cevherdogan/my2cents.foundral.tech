# Foundral Identity & Prerequisites — Quickstart

## Three-layer model
1) You (personal): never mix with experiments
2) Foundral (umbrella): continuity layer (email, domain, accounts)
3) Projects: books, atlases, Donate!!, experiments

## Email
- One primary inbox (anchor): hello@foundral.*
- Use aliases for projects (forward to anchor):
  - donate@foundral.*
  - atlas@foundral.*
  - books@foundral.*

## Phone
- One number is fine; keep it private.
- Optional later: a virtual business line.

## Domains
- One primary domain for orientation and index.
- Use subdomains for clean separation:
  - books.*  atlas.*  experiments.*  donate.*

## Accounts (minimum before publishing)
- Substack, Gumroad, Amazon KDP, Heyzine using the Foundral anchor email.
